#subtitle: Building ties with national liberation and socialist movements across the world.

Where should we send our members abroad?

- @sp_it: Learn electoral tactics from the Italian Communist party and discuss trade union work with the Communist Party of Spain.
- @ge_it: Train the INLA under the direction of the Red Army Faction in Germany, and the Red Brigades in Italy. 
- @etuc: Pressure trade unionists in the European Trade Union Confederation to take action against the British government.
- @palestine: Contact sympathisers in the Palestinian national liberation movement in the hope to develop our military capabilities.
- @return: We do not need international contacts at the moment.
