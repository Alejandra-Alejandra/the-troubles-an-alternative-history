The North has risen up and the British have fallen back to the eastern parts of the country, though they still hold onto Belfast. The war will continue to rage on, but the spectre of socialism now haunts the Island of Ireland. The bourgeois government down south is in complete panic.

The North has risen up and the British have fallen back to the eastern parts of the country, though they still hold onto Belfast given our control of the southern government, it seems clear that the British government will soon relinquish control over the place. Thousands of protestants have already started fleeing to Britain, though some Protestants remain.

The North has risen up and the British have fallen back to the eastern parts of the country, though they still hold onto Belfast. Fianna FÃ¡il has demanded that the British relinquish the north to the southern government, and for immediate local elections to be held. Given our role in the liberation of the north, and our successful propagandising, we will almost certainly sweep control of nationalist areas. With our popularity down south growing as well we can look forward to a bright future for socialist politics in Ireland. Perhaps we will even lead a worker's government in the next election and begin the transition to socialism?

This game is an attempt to (as realistically as possible) depict various paths that the labour movement failed to go down in Ireland during the 70s and 80s.

I have tried to display the real and dramatic consequences of those failures on the people of Ireland: the poor Catholics in Derry, the victims of sectarian violence, the victims of the drug trade and the economic crises that ravaged the country.

Whether or not these issues could have been avoided at all even is hard to answer, but nonetheless these issues are worth narrating.

The endless violence that denizens of the North faced visits Gaza every day, tenfold. Please look at the following websites to help inform yourselves about the issue:
