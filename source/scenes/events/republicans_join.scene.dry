= Disafeccted Republicans Consider Joining the IRSP

With the IRSP bolstering its progressive credentials recently, and its overtures towards the trade unions, many reformist minded republicans consider joining our party. They see us a progressive alternative to the provisionals, and as being sufficiently republican, which is not the case for Fianna FÃ¡il.

- @Let_Them_In: Let them into the party! With the costelloite in one hand and the ballot box in the other we shall conquer this Island!
- @We_Reject_Them: We reject letting them in, at least for now.

unavailable-subtitle: We need better relations with independent republicans to get them to join.

The traditionalists are shocked by our decision. However, our membership numbers swell, and our influence in the trade union movement increases further.

@We_Reject_Them

They are disappointed.
