= Rallying in Belfast

We have decided to hold a rally in Belfast, what should the focus of our rally be?

- @british_violence: We hold a rally against the violence of the British army and unionist paramilitaries up north and demand an end to their attacks on Catholic civillians.
- @workers: We hold a rally demanding increased worker control of industry, further worker protections and higher wages.
- @inequality: We hold a rally denouncing discrimination against Catholics in the work place, and in housing.
- @unification: We hold a rally demanding unification.
- @democracy: We hold a rally denouncing the power held by the unionist parties, and demand an end to gerrymandering and voter repression.
