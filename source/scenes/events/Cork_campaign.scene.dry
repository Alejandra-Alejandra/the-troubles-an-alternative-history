= Rallying in Dublin

We have decided to hold a rally in Cork, what should the focus of our rally be?

- @british_violence: We hold a rally against the violence of the British army and unionist paramilitaries up north and demand an end to their attacks on Catholic civillians.
- @workers: We hold a rally demanding increased worker control of industry, further worker protections and higher wages.
- @unification: We hold a rally demanding unification.
- @courts: We hold a rally denouncing the repression in the free state, and specifically denounce the existence of the Special Criminal Court as anti-democratic and authoritarian.
