Mass rallies are a feature of every day life. Should we organise a rally in one of the big cities?

- @Dublin: Dublin, the capital of the free state.
- @Belfast: Belfast, the largest city in Ulster deeply umbroiled in sectarian conflict between Catholics and Protestants.
- @Cork: The largest city in Munster, it is the main base of Fianna FÃ¡il, and while republicans have little sway here, many here sympathise with the struggle up north.
- @Limerick: The second largest city in Munster and the industrial heart of Ireland's Mid-West region, it has long been home to radical socialists.
- @Galway: The largest city in Connacht and a bastion of conservative politics in Ireland, worker parties have historically had very little influence in the area.
- @Derry: The second largest city in Ulster many Catholics live here. It is heavily policed by the British army.
- @brokie: We do not wish to organise a campaign right now.
